# Starlight, Kitchen Sink edition
---

This version of [Starlight](https://github.com/paulcuth/starlight) includes the runtime, parser, DOMAPI and a build of Babel.js. 

This edition allows you to parse Lua directly in the browser, with access to the page. For other ways to use Starlight, see the main Github repo.

See `/index.html` for usage examples.

Build these files from the main Starlight repo, using `grunt kitchen-sink`.
